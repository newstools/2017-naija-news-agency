Aliyu Aziz, the Director-General of the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC), has warned that any Nigerian without the National Identification Number (NIN), issued by the commission runs the risk of being regarded as a non-Nigerian citizen. Aziz stated this at the  world press conference held at NIMC Lagos office against the backdrop of the Federal Government’s renewed efforts, spearheaded by NIMC, to enlighten Nigerians on the importance of enrolling to obtain the National Identification Number, which fully confers on any citizen so enrolled Nigerian citizenship. “It is the duty of every citizen to enroll and obtain his or her National Identification Number, which entitles one to be fully regarded as a Nigeria citizen,” he said, adding that “without the NIN, anyone’s claims of being a Nigeria citizen are doubtful; that is what the NIMC Act stipulates.” NIMC was established by the NIMC Act No. 23 of 2007, as an offshoot of the Department of National Civic Registration (DNCR), to create, establish and maintain a Unique National Identity Database, register persons covered by the Act, assign a Unique National Identification (NIN), provide authentication platform for identity verification, issue General Multi-Purpose Cards (GMPC) and harmonise and integrate existing identification database in Nigeria. During the media interaction, Aziz clarified the misconception held by some sections of the society that NIMC’s primary role was merely the production and issuance of National Identity Cards to citizens. Identifying the role of the media as pivotal to the success of the Federal Government’s target to enroll every citizen and issue same with the NIN, Engr. Aziz urged journalists to help in enlightening the public on the urgency and importance of enrolling and obtaining the NIN for the many benefits this brings to the individual citizen and the country as a whole. Specifically, he called on the media to deepen their understanding of NIMC’s functions, roles and mandate , as well as the challenges the commission is beset with, in order to be adequately informed and thereby mobilize the public to perform their civic responsibility of authenticating their citizenship, which can only be done by enrolling and obtaining the NIN. Reeling out the many benefits of the NIN, Engr. Aziz said these include “one person one identity, enhances participation in the political process, important tool for fight against corruption and terrorism, enables citizens to exercise their rights and facilitates management of subsides and safety net payments such as apply to Internal Displaced Persons,” Other benefits of the NIN are that is facilitates service delivery in Ministries, Departments and Agencies; enhances the work of law enforcement agencies thereby providing public safety, policy, national security and border protection, helps launder Nigeria’s image, elimination of ghost and multiple identities and enhances ability of citizens to assert their identity. Speaking on the key achievements of the Commission, Engr. Aziz listed the populating of the National Identity Database, which currently boasts of about 18.5 million records, the establishment of up to 809 NIN enrolment centres nationwide, launch of the new electronic National ID Card with multiple functions, achievemenent of GVCP Certification and recertification of the NIMC Card Personasation Bureau in 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017, Backend Infrastructures among others. In listing the key challenges the commission faces in the execution of its mandate and targets, the Director General named funding as the overriding hindrance. He also lamented poor staff remuneration, which leads to constant loss of strategic human resources.
